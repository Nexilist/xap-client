# xap-client
So yeah, this thing was made by me, I was very bored so I took T_Tape's Menu and grinder's features and put them together to create this monstrosity. The code is still very messy so if you want to improve it, go ahead.
I'll will be very grateful if you do so.

**Disclaimer: This code is for educational purposes only .**

# Updates
- FOV Circle (You'll have to manually set the Game FOV in ESP section, cl_fovScale broke so idk how to get game's FOV automatically)
- FOV now scales with Scopes's zoom
- Fixed Sense
- Fixed Aimbot Prediction
- RCS
- Offsets fixes
- Bone Selection is now replaced with auto select best bone
- Removed Allow Target Switch because it somehow causes xap-client to crash
- Aim-Assist will no longer be activated while holding grenade
- Add Aim in ADS
- Add Spectator list
